# Gazebo Simulation

Quadruped simulation and control with OM1.

## Simulation Instructions

The Gazebo simulator is an very sophisticated, industry standard, simulator for robots. The robot shape/size is specified via `.dae` files and those robots can then navigate a defined digital world. The simulation framework is useful for prototyping, debugging, and reinforcement learning, among many other uses. 

### MacOS (Gazebo Harmonic)

```bash
./gazebo/macOS.sh
```
The script also checks and installs Gazebo Harmonic https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/getstarted/ if not already installed. If this is your first time installing Gazebo, grab a coffee, since this will take a while (1/2 hour or more). 

This will open a gazebo room with a bathtub and chairs. Now, add your robot!

In a different terminal, boot OM1 using the example config:
```bash
uv run src/run.py quadruped_sim
```

**Finally, start the simulation by clicking the "play" (>) button in the Gazebo simulator.**

NOTE: Remember to set the correct API key in the `config/quadruped_sim.json5` file or in your `.env`.

### Ubuntu (Gazebo Classic)

```bash
./gazebo/ubuntu.sh
```
For now, ROS2 is required for the simulation to interact with OM1 in Gazebo Classic, check https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html for installation instructions.

ffmpeg is required for streaming the simulated video feed to OM1. If your system doesn't have `ffmpeg`, you should install it using `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` to run the program.

_Note1:_ The simulated camera feed is streamed to a virtual video device at `/dev/video10`, thus requiring the `camera_index` in the VLM config to be 10. Modify as needed if the virtual camera needs to be reordered or if OM1 needs to read from another camera.

_Note2:_ It is also possible to run the Gazebo Harmonic simulation on Ubuntu.
