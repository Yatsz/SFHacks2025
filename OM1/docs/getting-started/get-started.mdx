## System Requirements

### Operating System

- macOS 12.0+
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

### Hardware

- Memory (RAM): 8GB
- Storage: 16GB
- Webcam: 1080p
- Speakers
- Microphone

### Software

- Python 3.10+
- uv 0.6.2
- [Openmind API key](https://portal.openmind.org/)

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

#### Package Manager

```bash Mac
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

``` bash Linux
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
``` 

#### UV (A Rust and Python package manager)

``` bash Mac
brew install uv
```

``` bash Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### PortAudio Library

This will let you speak to the LLM and it will generate voice outputs. On Mac and Linux, you need `portaudio`.

```bash Mac
brew install portaudio
```

```bash Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev
```

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository

Run the following commands to clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash clone repo
git clone https://github.com/OpenmindAGI/OM1.git
cd OM1
git submodule update --init
uv venv
```

2. Set the configuration variables

Locate the `config` folder and add your Openmind API key in `/config/spot.json`. If you do not already have one, you can obtain a free access key at https://portal.openmind.org/.  _Note:_ Using the placeholder key **openmind-free** will generate errors.

```bash set api key
# /config/spot.json
...
"api_key": "om1_live_e4252f1cf005af..."
...
```

3. Run the Spot Agent

Run the following command to start the Spot Agent:

```bash
uv run src/run.py spot
```

Some necessary packages will be installed during this process, the first time you run the command. This might take a little time. Please be patient. Then you will see the system come to life:

```bash
Object Detector INPUT
// START
You see a person in front of you. You also see a laptop.
// END

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
command: move
    A movement to be performed by the agent.
    Effect: Allows the agent to move.
    Arguments: Allowed values: 'stand still', 'sit', 'dance', 'shake paw', 'walk', 'walk back', 'run', 'jump', 'wag tail'

command: speak
    Words to be spoken by the agent.
    Effect: Allows the agent to speak.
    Arguments: <class 'str'>

command: emotion
    A facial expression to be performed by the agent.
    Effect: Performs a given facial expression.
    Arguments: Allowed values: 'cry', 'smile', 'frown', 'think', 'joy'

What will you do? Command: 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openmind.org/api/core/openai/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:OpenAI LLM output: commands=[Command(type='move', value='wag tail'), Command(type='speak', value="Hi there! I see you and I'm excited!"), Command(type='emotion', value='joy')]
```

#### Explanation of the log data

The response above provides insight into how the spot agent processes its environment and decides on its next actions.
  - First, it detects a person using vision.
  - Next, it decides on a friendly action (dancing and speaking).
  - Expresses emotions via facial displays.
  - Logs latency and processing times to monitor system performance.
  - Communicates with an external AI API for response generation.

Overall, the system follows a predefined behavior where spotting a person triggers joyful interactions, driven by the LLM-assisted decision-making process.
