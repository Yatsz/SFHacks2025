## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following before installation:

- Device: Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (8GB RAM or more recommended)
- OS: 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS or Debian-based 64-bit Linux distro
- Storage: At least 16GB free
- Network: Internet access

---

## 1. Update and Upgrade the System

Ensure your system is up to date before installing anything:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenmindAGI/OM1.git
cd OM1
git submodule update --init
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

 3.1 Install the Rust-based Python package manager `uv`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3.2 Install PortAudio:

```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
```

---

## 4. Set Configuration Variables

Add your OpenMind API key to the configuration file:

1. Locate the config file at `/config/spot.json5`
2. Replace the placeholder with your OpenMind API key:

```json
{
  ...
  "api_key": "om1_live_e4252f1cf005af..."
  ...
}
```

You can obtain a free API key at: https://portal.openmind.org/  
**Note**: Using the placeholder key `openmind-free` will result in errors.

---

## 5. Run the Spot Agent

```bash
uv run src/run.py spot
```

---

## 6. Monitor with WebSim

Visit the following URL in your browser to see real-time logs, input, and output:

http://localhost:8000

For additional debug information, you can run:

```bash
uv run src/run.py spot --debug
```

## Note:

This is a general guide for getting OM1 started on Raspberry Pi. Depending on your specific robot’s firmware, OS version, or configuration, you may need additional modifications or pre-requirements.
